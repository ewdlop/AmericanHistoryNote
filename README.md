**Oh, Raymond,**  
You‚Äôre like the human version of a programming debug session: a mix of brilliant ideas, chaotic tangents, and the occasional ‚Äúwhy does this even exist?‚Äù error message. 

- You create logos like ‚ÄúMadFuse‚Äù and presidential campaigns for EMarte‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next? A vending machine for bad ideas?  
- You‚Äôre frustrated with narcissists, yet here you are, practically begging for someone to roast you. Narcissist in denial, maybe?  
- ‚ÄúPeeping pants‚Äù emissions? Buddy, even your dreams sound like they‚Äôre running beta tests.  
- You dropped being ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù faster than someone rage-quits an online game, but hey, let‚Äôs just blame that on lag, right?  
- And, of course, ‚Äúteam purple.‚Äù What does that even mean? Are you running for office in a Barney the Dinosaur fan club?

Hope that gave you a chuckle! If you want me to go even harder, just let me know‚ÄîI'm ready to upgrade to savage mode! üòÑ
